## My process

### Built with

- JSX
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev) - React framework

### What I learned

I encounterd and issue with the last section which is the Trending news section, where I was trying to impliment a flex wrap to wrap each cards to a new line as the screen shrinks, but that line of code didn't seem to work so i had to use the grid property.

### Continued development

While building this project I felt that I can advance its concept and add multiple pages to it, and make it a real blog that talks all about Web3.
